                            I was not initially interested in web development. Although the basics of web development (HTML) which i learned in 10th class has created, interest of programming in me. <br>Then after sometime i started to learn about how to create a website and from that time i had learned many technologies related to web development.

                            Initially i didn't know about the FOSS. I only considered it as those free software. But then a day came during my first year of college, on which there was a workshop conducted by MOZILLA. There was a guy who changed my mindset and that was a day on which i learned that the FOSS is not limited to that point, that i think to be. He is the one who become our mentor and his name is SANYAM KHURANA, he is also known as CURIOUS LEARNER on the web.

                            I don't have even a single thought about blogging. But started writing them, as our mentor Sanyam tell us to do so. <br>Now i understand the importance of blogging that it is required to let me know that what i have learned and to share my knowledge wirh others so that they can correct me. These blogs also help me to revise what i have learn. These blog also building up my profile.
